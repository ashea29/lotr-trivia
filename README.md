# LOTR Trivia

A simple Lord of the Rings trivia game.


# Motivation

I built this trivia game as my Project 1 for General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive Remote program. I decided to specifically build a Lord of the Rings trivia game, because I’m a huge fan of the works of Tolkien. My goal for this project was to build something simple but functional, hence I purposefully took a simpler approach in the code (i.e. - there may have been many much more slick ways to achieve the same thing, but I went the simple route in order to get a viable product). I plan to implement more features over time, and perhaps refactor the game logic.


# Technologies/Frameworks Used

For this project, I mostly used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. However, I also incorporated Normalize.css as well as the Materialize CSS framework - specifically the grid, to aid in making the game responsive.


# How to Use

Play, and enjoy!


# Known Issues

There were some issues in making the game look good on different screen sizes. For the most part, the app should look good on computers with an average-size monitor, as well as on most iPhone-size phones (though with some of the questions the text for the answer choices is a bit out of sorts). Eventually, I plan to rework some of the styling to try to fix this issue, and to add more responsiveness for various screen sizes.
