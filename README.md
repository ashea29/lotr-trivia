# LOTR Trivia

A simple Lord of the Rings trivia game.


# Motivation

I built this trivia game as Project 1 for General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive Remote program. I decided to specifically build a Lord of the Rings trivia game, because I’m a huge fan of the works of Tolkien. My goal for this project was to build something simple but functional, hence I purposefully took a simpler approach in the code (i.e. - there may have been many much more slick ways to achieve the same thing, but I went the simple route in order to get a viable product). I plan to implement more features over time, and perhaps refactor the game logic.
